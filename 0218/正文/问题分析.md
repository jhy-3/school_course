根据题目要求，这是个人投资，投资金额少，因此投资决策应符合市场普遍规律以降低风险、提高收益。

According to the question, this is a personal investment, the investment amount is small, so the investment decision should be in line with the general laws of the market to reduce risk and increase returns.

对于黄金交易，黄金价格既受短期因素影响，也受长期因素影响。短期因素具有不确定性，突发性，所以短时间内不建议去做择时。中长期择时模型受到美联储货币政策和经济周期本特点影响，可控性高。对比来看，可以直观地判断出结果，但这些经济数据很难提前进行预测。

For gold trading, gold price is influenced by both short-term and long-term factors. Short-term factors have uncertainty and suddenness, so it is not recommended to go for timing in short time. Medium and long term timing models are influenced by the Fed's monetary policy and the nature of the economic cycle and are highly controllable. In contrast, the results can be judged visually, but these economic data are difficult to forecast in advance.

==在复杂的驱动因素下，我们建议大家长期配置，这样不管时间怎么变、不同的时间阶段背后的因子怎么变，我们最终可以获得长期的收益，最终只是放弃一些短期可能有，也可能没有的波段性的收益，这些收益我们不建议个人投资者去参与这些短期的波动。因此，对于黄金交易我们建议保持小仓位长期配置，即5%~10%==

With the complex drivers, we recommend a long-term allocation so that no matter how time changes and how the factors behind different time phases change, we can end up with long-term gains and ultimately just give up some short-term gains that may or may not be volatile, gains that we do not recommend individual investors to engage in these short-term fluctuations. Therefore, for gold trading we recommend keeping a small position long-term allocation, i.e. 5% to 10%

==对于比特币交易，我们倾向于定投方式。在股票领域，定投已经被证明是一种适合普通人的操作策略。定期定额买入，投入较少的时间精力获得市场平均水平的收益。我们认为定投同样适用于比特币，定时分批买入，有效的平滑掉价格的剧烈波动，降低持有成本==。

For bitcoin trading, we prefer the automatic investment plan. In the stock world, fixed investment has proven to be a suitable operating strategy for the average person. Buy in regular fixed amounts and invest less time and effort to get market average returns. We believe that fixed investment is also applicable to bitcoin, buying at regular intervals, effectively smoothing out the dramatic price fluctuations and reducing the cost of holding



因此，我们决定建立多阶段决策模型，定期改变黄金比特币持有比例，其余时间保持该比例，停止交易，以达到降低风险，提高收益的目的。

Therefore, we decided to build a multi-stage decision model to periodically change the percentage of gold bitcoin holdings and maintain that percentage the rest of the time and stop trading in order to achieve lower risk and higher returns.

从另一个方面来说，证券市场是一个动态变化的复杂系统，人们难以获得证券收益的总体信息，只能根据证券历史信息对随机收益的参数或概率分布进行经验估计，证券收益可以被认为是模糊变量而不仅仅是随机变量。

On the other hand, the securities market is a complex system with dynamic changes, and it is difficult for people to obtain overall information about securities returns; they can only make empirical estimates of the parameters or probability distributions of random returns based on historical information about securities, and securities returns can be considered as fuzzy variables rather than just random variables.

梯形模糊数已被证明适宜度量证券收益率。因此本文使用此理论对收益进行预测并且将投资策略的“时间非一致性”纳入研究框架，提出具有多约束（时间，收益，基数），多阶段均值-标准半方差模糊投资组合模型，并研究其时间一致性的最优投资策略。由于存在交易成本、收益需求和基数约束，该模型是一个具有路径依赖性的混合整数半闭环动态优化问题。我们使用离散近似迭代算法求出其最优时间一致的投资策略。

The trapezoidal fuzzy number has been shown to be an appropriate measure of security returns. Therefore, this paper uses this theory to predict returns and incorporates the "time inconsistency" of investment strategies into the research framework, proposing a multi-constrained (time, return, basis), multi-stage mean-standard semi-covariance fuzzy portfolio model and investigating its time-consistent optimal investment strategies. The model is a path-dependent mixed-integer semi-closed-loop dynamic optimization problem due to the presence of transaction cost, return demand, and basis constraints. We use a discrete approximation iterative algorithm to find its optimal time-consistent investment strategy.

为验证模型对交易成本的敏感程度，我们让佣金的抽取额度从0.0001开始以十倍速度增长，到0.01停止。各阶段交易额度的变化即可体现模型的敏感性。

To verify the sensitivity of the model to transaction costs, we let the commission drawdown increase at a tenfold rate starting at 0.0001 and stopping at 0.01. The sensitivity of the model is captured by the change in the transaction amount at each stage.

考虑到实际金融活动中的投资者是“有限理性的”，投资者的心理因素会影响其投资行为。我们使用投资者对“后悔”心理的具体量度来证明我们的模型是最佳模型。交易员后悔程度越低，模型所提供的决策越使交易员满意，模型越成功。 

Considering that investors in real financial activities are "finite rational", the psychological factors of investors affect their investment behavior. We introduce a specific measure of investor's psychology of "regret" to demonstrate that our model is the best model. The lower the level of trader regret, the more satisfying the decision provided by the model is to the trader, and the more successful the model is.
