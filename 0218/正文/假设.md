```
There is no limit to the maximum and minimum transaction amount each time a trader can buy or sell gold and bitcoin.
To simplify the model, we assume that the minimum amount per transaction is 0, with no upper limit, but no debit or credit will occur.

Traders base their decisions to buy and sell bitcoin and gold on attached data, independent of the people and circumstances around them.
When people make a decision to buy or sell, they usually receive many factors, such as the evaluation of people around them, the current situation of life, and the news on the Internet. In this question, when we make a trading decision, we are restricted by the requirements of the question to consider only the attached data factors and are not influenced by the rest of the factors.
Investors are more concerned about downside risks.
When analyzing the psychology of investor regret, we argue that the intensity of loss emotions is greater than the intensity of gain emotions.
