模型优缺点

优点

1.全面性 我们的模型不仅考虑了收益，还考虑了投资者投资时承担的风险。我们的模型在使投资者收益尽量大的情况下，承担风险尽量小。

2.创新性 引入对投资者后悔心理的具体量度来证明模型的优越性，并以此来衡量模型的成功程度

3.适用性 理论上，在没有发生重大国际事件的情况下，该模型可在长时间不断自我更新，具有很强的适用性

4.

 

缺点

1.因为考虑了投资者要承担的风险，提出的决策偏向保守，可能会让投资者错过某些收益。

2.决策主要受截至作出投资决定当日的价格数据的影响，不考虑其余因素：如国际局势，政策影响等。因素较单一，可能导致结果与最优结果有差异。

ad:
1.Comprehensiveness  Our model takes into account not only the returns, but also the risks that investors take when investing. Our model takes as little risk as possible while making the investor's return as large as possible.
2.Innovativeness  Introduce a specific measure of investor regret psychology to demonstrate the superiority of the model and use it to measure the success of the model.
3.Applicability  Theoretically, in the absence of major international events, the model can continuously update itself over long periods of time and is highly applicable.
dis:
1.Because the risks to be taken by investors are considered, the decisions proposed are on the conservative side ,may cause investors to miss out on certain gains.
2.The decision is mainly influenced by the price data as of the date of the investment decision and does not take into account other factors: international situation, policy implications, etc. The factors are relatively homogeneous and may lead to results that differ from the optimal ones.
